# Company_HR_Tableau_Dashboard

Problem statement:

The Human Resources Department of a Medium-sized Business Enteprise is currently using a legacy system for the hiring of new employees and the training, promotion of employees along with miscellaneous duties of a typical HR Department. This arrangement is becoming sub-optimal as the business continues to expand further in terms of headcount and business operations. Therefore, the new Head of Human Resources has initiated an effort to track key HR statistics using data analytics tools.

Objective:
Create a dashboard for the Head of Human Resources for the purposes of diagnostic analytics

Steps taken:
1) Key information regarding employees of an SME were extracted from a XLSX File named 'HR Data Analysis'.

2) Data Cleaning and Validation were done on the dataset when required and imported into Tableau.
   
4) Relevant Data Visualizations were made in an easily understandable manner for the purpose of diagnostic analytics that will be very useful for company executives who are examining the salary packages of existing employees and whether the company is expanding its workforce fast enough to capitalize on growth opportunities in the industry they are in.
